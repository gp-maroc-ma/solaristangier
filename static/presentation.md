Solaris

# Company History

Our first manufacturing plant was established in 2018 in Al Hoceima, becoming the first 250 MW solar panel plant in
Morocco & the largest in Africa. Founded under the parent company GPM Holding’s umbrella, the company initially focused
on supplying Solaris’ modules for solar farms throughout Morocco. In 2024, the company launched a new 750 MW facility in
a free trade zone, taking advantage of tax & tariff exemptions to optimize costs for serving international clients,
Since its inception, Solaris Tangier has maintained its position as Africa’s largest PV solar module manufacturer.

# Mission

At Solaris Tangier, our mission is to drive the global transition to sustainable energy by delivering cutting-edge,
high-efficiency photovoltaic solar solutions. We are committed to advancing the quality & affordability of solar
technology by maintaining flexibility in our product design & modular manufacturing processes in our state-of-the-art
facility. Our aim is to ensure energy independence for our clients & promote environmental responsibility.

# Vision

Solaris Tangier envisions becoming Africa’s leading hub for solar panel manufacturing, supporting Morocco’s renewable
energy goals and reducing international reliance on China-centric supply chains. We aim to deliver ethically sourced,
high-efficiency solar solutions that meet the needs of both African & North American markets, driving sustainable energy
worldwide.

# Facility Overview

## Location and Infrastructure

### Strategic Location of Manufacturing Plant

Solaris Tangier is located in Tangier's TAC (Tangier Automotive City) Free Zone, minutes away from Africa's largest port
Tanger Med.

### Facility Size, Layout, and Production Areas

The Solaris plant is a >10000 sqm space with a capacity of 750 MW per annum. We also have capability of doubling the
capacity of the factory within 6-12 months.

## Manufacturing Capabilities

### Current Production Lines and Technologies

Solaris Tangier’s production line is fully automated, utilizing state of the art technology to manufacture our panels.
The panels are assembled using Italian supplier Ecoprogetti's fully automated European manufactured production line.

# Technical Due Diligence

## Facility Capabilities

### Compatibility with State-of-the-Art PV Panel Production

The current Solaris production line is compatible with all cell wafer sizes available on the market as of 2026. The line
can produce glass-glass modules, glass-backsheet modules, modules with or without aluminum frames, custom sized modules
per client request, and more.

### Readiness to Produce TOPCon and HJT Panels

The current production line is compatible with PERC and TOPCon technologies as is. It will soon be updated to produce
HJT modules as well.

## PV Technology Assessment

### PERC Technology:

Status: Actively producing and supplying PERC solar panels.
Key Features: Proven, reliable technology with widespread field data.
Good efficiency (~22%) at a cost-effective level.
Well-suited for existing manufacturing processes and customer demands.

### HJT Technology:

Integration Timeline: Targeted for implementation in 2026.
Key Features: Highest efficiency potential (~25% or more) with bifacial gains. Excellent performance in high-temperature
environments, reducing energy losses.
Requires new manufacturing equipment, leading to higher initial costs.

### TOPCon Technology:

Integration Timeline: Ready for production upon demand
Key Features: Higher efficiency than PERC (~23-24%).
Easy to integrate into existing PERC production lines with relatively low capital expenditure.
Improved passivation and lower recombination losses, enhancing performance.

### Key Considerations:

PERC's Proven Reliability: PERC will remain an essential part of the portfolio until TOPCon and HJT reach full
production capacity.
Balance of Cost and Efficiency: While HJT offers the highest efficiency, TOPCon serves as a cost-effective intermediate
step between PERC and HJT, ensuring competitive pricing and performance.
Ethical Manufacturing:  Throughout the roadmap, Solaris Tangier emphasizes ethical sourcing, avoiding China-centric
supply chains to meet the demand from North American and other markets.

## Technology Assessment

### Product Certifications & Standards

Solaris Tangier’s new facility is certified per ISO 9001, ISO 14001, & ISO 45001 standards, as well as IEC 61215 &
61730.
The modules produced at the Solaris facility will bear the certification mark of the following certifying bodies:

- IEC certifications through TUV for EU & African market
- UL/CSA certification for North American market
- PVEL PQP for USA market

### Panel Capacity Flexibility

Solaris Tangier’s current production line is working with 3 varying sizes of modules all using the G12 solar cell.
The power output ranges from 380W to 680W an can be adjusted according to the client’s demand.

### Equipment Vendor Capabilities

Ecoprogetti is an Italian company that manufactures state of the art PV module manufacturing equipment.
They are certified per international & EU standards, and they boast more than 30GW of installed solar production
systems globally.

+30 GW Installed (Up-to 2024)

- South East Asia +800 MW
- Middle East Africa +3.5 GW
- United States +4.3 GW
- India +10.3 GW
- Europe +11.4 GW

# Commercial Due Diligence

## Industry Standing & Sourcing

### Solaris Tangier’s Position in the Global PV Industry

Solaris Tangier’s panel performance is on par with industry leaders. We cater to clients who demand the highest
standards in quality, ethical sourcing, and manufacturing in regions with non-controversial labor practices.

### Sourcing Strategy for Raw Materials & Compliance with US Tax Credit Qualifications

Solaris Tangier has initiated strategic partnerships with cell suppliers capable of providing full documentation
verifying the ethical sourcing of polysilicon used in their manufacturing process. In addition, we will furnish all
requisite shipping and commercial paperwork to our clients to guarantee a smooth and efficient customs clearance
process.

### Competitiveness in the US Market

Morocco and the USA have mutually benefitted from a Free Trade Agreement since 2004, under which our USA clientele can
import our panels free from tariffs or duties (currently at 10% Q1 of 2026). With this advantage coupled with the
relatively lower labor and utilities costs, Solaris Tangier is well positioned to produce at a competitive price for the
US market.

## Bankability & Ownership
