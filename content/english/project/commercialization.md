## Industry Standing & Sourcing

#### Solaris Tangier’s Position in the Global PV Industry

Solaris Tangier’s panel performance is on par with industry leaders. We cater to clients who demand the highest
standards in quality, ethical sourcing, and manufacturing in regions with non-controversial labor practices.

#### Sourcing Strategy for Raw Materials & Compliance with US Tax Credit Qualifications

Solaris Tangier has initiated strategic partnerships with cell suppliers capable of providing full documentation
verifying the ethical sourcing of polysilicon used in their manufacturing process. In addition, we will furnish all
requisite shipping and commercial paperwork to our clients to guarantee a smooth and efficient customs clearance
process.

#### Competitiveness in the US Market

Morocco and the USA have mutually benefitted from a Free Trade Agreement since 2004, under which our USA clientele can
import our panels free from tariffs or duties (currently at 10% Q1 of 2026). With this advantage coupled with the
relatively lower labor and utilities costs, Solaris Tangier is well positioned to produce at a competitive price for the
US market.

## Bankability & Ownership

#### Bankability & Reinsurance

Third party reinsurance is available on a project-by-project basis. ISO, IEC, and PVEL certifications for panel
performance and facility conformity are available for project bankability requirements.

Solaris also provides a comprehensive product and performance warranty for all panels sold. The standard warranty
extends to 12 years for product and 30 years for performance.

#### Solaris Tangier Ownership

Solaris Tangier operates as an independent entity and is not affiliated with any other global manufacturers. It is a
Moroccan company owned by American businessman, Philip W. Jenkins.

Solaris Tangier ownership documents show Philip W. Jenkins Jr. as the sole shareholder. Documentation relating to
ownership, company registration, or otherwise can be shared upon request.
