## Facility Capabilities

#### Compatibility with State-of-the-Art PV Panel Production

The current Solaris production line is compatible with all cell wafer sizes available on the market as of 2026. The line
can produce glass-glass modules, glass-backsheet modules, modules with or without aluminum frames, custom sized modules
per client request, and more.

#### Readiness to Produce TOPCon and HJT Panels

The current production line is compatible with PERC and TOPCon technologies as is. It will soon be updated to produce
HJT modules as well.

## PV Technology Assessment

#### PERC Technology:

Status: Actively producing and supplying PERC solar panels.
Key Features: Proven, reliable technology with widespread field data.
Good efficiency (~22%) at a cost-effective level.
Well-suited for existing manufacturing processes and customer demands.

#### HJT Technology:

Integration Timeline: Targeted for implementation in 2026.
Key Features: Highest efficiency potential (~25% or more) with bifacial gains. Excellent performance in high-temperature
environments, reducing energy losses.
Requires new manufacturing equipment, leading to higher initial costs.

#### TOPCon Technology:

Integration Timeline: Ready for production upon demand
Key Features: Higher efficiency than PERC (~23-24%).
Easy to integrate into existing PERC production lines with relatively low capital expenditure.
Improved passivation and lower recombination losses, enhancing performance.

#### Key Considerations:

PERC's Proven Reliability: PERC will remain an essential part of the portfolio until TOPCon and HJT reach full
production capacity.
Balance of Cost and Efficiency: While HJT offers the highest efficiency, TOPCon serves as a cost-effective intermediate
step between PERC and HJT, ensuring competitive pricing and performance.
Ethical Manufacturing:  Throughout the roadmap, Solaris Tangier emphasizes ethical sourcing, avoiding China-centric
supply chains to meet the demand from North American and other markets.

## Technology Assessment

#### Product Certifications & Standards

Solaris Tangier’s new facility is certified per ISO 9001, ISO 14001, & ISO 45001 standards, as well as IEC 61215 & 61730.
The modules produced at the Solaris facility will bear the certification mark of the following certifying bodies:

- IEC certifications through TUV for EU & African market
- UL/CSA certification for North American market
- PVEL PQP for USA market

#### Panel Capacity Flexibility

Solaris Tangier’s current production line is working with 3 varying sizes of modules all using the G12 solar cell.
The power output ranges from 380W to 680W an can be adjusted according to the client’s demand.

#### Equipment Vendor Capabilities

Ecoprogetti is an Italian company that manufactures state of the art PV module manufacturing equipment.
They are certified per international & EU standards, and they boast more than 30GW of installed solar production
systems globally.

+30 GW Installed (Up-to 2024)
